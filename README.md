<h1>A simple chess game to run in terminal!</h1>
<p>Note: This personal project is not set up with a build system. This is because it was initially written on Repl.it using repl's built in compiler.</p>
<h2><strong>To run:<strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Install VSCode Extension Pack for Java</li>
    <li>Run Main.java once to open the environment, then stop it</li>
    <li>Run "chcp 65001" to set your code page to UTF-8 (enables cool chess emojis)</li>
    <li>Run Main.java again and zoom in a few times / resize terminal to view the board</li>
    <li>Play chess!</li>
</ul>
